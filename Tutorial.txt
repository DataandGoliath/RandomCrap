How to Compile C Programs

 By: Srikanth Ramesh |  Last Updated: 06/01/2017
In many of my previous posts especially in the Programming section, I have used C as the programming language for writing the programs. If you’re new to C programming and find it difficult to compile the C source codes then this post is for you.
Here is a step-by-step procedure to install Borland C++ compiler 5.5 on your PC and compile the C programs.
How to Install Borland C++ compiler?
Follow the below steps to install Borland C++ compiler 5.5 on your PC:
Download Borland C++ compiler 5.5 (for Windows platform) from the following link:

Download Borland C++ 5.5
After you download, run the file C++5.51.exe. The default installation path would be:

C:\Borland\BCC55
How to configure Borland C++ compiler?
Here is a step-by-step instruction on how to configure the compiler:
After you install Borland C++ compier, create two new Text Documents.
Open the first New Text Document.txt file and add the following two lines into it:

-I"c:\Borland\Bcc55\include"


-L"c:\Borland\Bcc55\lib"


Save changes and close the file. Now rename the file from New Text Document.txt to bcc32.cfg.
Open the second New Text Document (2).txt file and add the following line into it:

-L"c:\Borland\Bcc55\lib"

Save changes and close the file. Rename the file from New Text Document (2).txt to ilink32.cfg.
Now copy the two files bcc32.cfg and ilink32.cfg, navigate to C:\Borland\BCC55\Bin and paste them.
How to Compile the C Source Code (.C files)?
Here is a detailed instruction on how to compile C source codes:
You need to place the .C (example.c) file to be compiled in the following location:

C:\Borland\BCC55\Bin
Now go to the command prompt (Start->Run->type cmd->Enter)
Make the following path as the present working directory (use the CD command):

C:\Borland\BCC55\Bin
To compile the file (example.c) use the following command:

bcc32 example.c
Now if there exists no error in the source code, you’ll get a compiled executable module (example.exe) in the same location (C:\Borland\BCC55\Bin).
Now you have successfully compiled the source code into an executable file(.exe file).

NOTE: The above tutorial assumes that you’ve installed the compiler onto the C: drive (by default).

Reinstall your C compiler and configure it properly.

@ FoXriDeR
Type “cd\” ENTER
then type “cd C:\Borland\BCC55\Bin” ENTER
This should work!

Srikanth says

@ a.j
Yes you can compile.. but it’ll be 16-bit… You need to compile it using a 32-bit to change it’s icon…

Hi Srikanth Keep up the good work.I really like what you are doing could you teach me.Im really interested.i know some basics oc C as we have programs in C in our college.
Richard says

Hi Srikanth,
I get to the point where you enter the command promt command to compile the file. Whenever I enter “bcc32 example.c” It says that there were 18 errors in compile. And thanks for putting, so much awesome stuff up on the site.
fametail says 
January 30, 2010 at 1:37 AM
yes, I have the same issue as Richard. I am honestly sure I have contacted you on this B4. I am trying to compile the trojan horse using these instructions.
Srikanth says 
February 12, 2010 at 2:05 PM
For all those who are having difficulty in compiling the programs
It is highly recommended that you have atleast a surface level knowledge of C language and know how to work with C Compilers. Otherwise it would be hard to debug the errors. So I am sorry for all those who have problems in compiling. It’s hard for me to answer each and everyone’s queries.
